This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

## One Root Layout vs Multiple Root Layouts

In the previous lecture, we added the (auth) route group and an auth-only layout (by adding a layout.js file in that (auth) folder).

Currently, this (auth)/layout.js layout will actually not replace the main root layout (i.e., the layout provided by app/layout.js).

Because route group layouts are actually nested into the main root layout unless there is no such root layout. I.e., if you would create another route group (e.g., (unauth)) and move the layout.js file into that folder, you would end up with multiple root layouts.

Therefore, if you're not doing that, you should edit the (auth)/layout.js file and remove the <html> and <body> elements in there. The app will work either way but it's technically incorrect.

Instead, your (auth)/layout.js file should look like this:

```
import '../globals.css';

export const metadata = {
  title: 'Next Auth',
  description: 'Next.js Authentication',
};

export default function AuthRootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <>
      <header id="auth-header">
        <p>Welcome back!</p>
        <form>
          <button>Logout</button>
        </form>
      </header>
      {children}
    </>
  );
}
```
